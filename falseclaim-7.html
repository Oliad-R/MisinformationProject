            <h2>The sun is a ball of fire. </h2>
            <p>It is impossible for the sun to be a ball of fire. In order to create combustion, we require oxygen, and oxygen is not present in space. The sun creates its energy through nuclear fusion. It is filled up with hydrogen atoms [17]. The abundance of these atoms is incredible, all of them held together with a large amount of gravity and pressure. The density of the hydrogen and the ferocity of the pressure causes the hydrogen atoms to collide with one another which is an intense force, creating helium [17]. This releases energy and then repeats over and over, creating a chain reaction. When this energy builds up, it can reach up to 27 million million degrees Fahrenheit in the sun’s core. This energy flows outward through the convective zone, and then onto the photosphere where it releases heat, charged particles, and light [17]. The Sun’s outward and inward pressures are all very well balanced allowing for the energy that comes to earth to come in a steady fashion [22]. 40% of this energy warms Earth, 25% the water cycle utilizes, a third is reflected back into space, 1% is taken in by wind and ocean currents, and then 0.023% is for plants and photosynthesis [22].</p>

            <h2>There are UFOs recharging with the Sun.</h2>
            <p>Many people are convinced that a spacecraft has been recharging itself through sucking in solar plasma, or that this footage depicts the start up of a new planet [19]. Although this news may be extremely exciting, it isn’t true, and NASA scientists have thoroughly disproved these claims. The activity that was captured is something that is quite frequent, called a “prominence” [20]. The filament that connected what was thought to be a UFO to the sun is a prominence. It withholds cooler, denser plasma than its surrounding corona which is 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit. When these prominences increase to the size that we see in the video, it’s a sign that they’re about to explode, which we observe in the footage [20]. The prominence is connected at the other end by a filament channel that resembles a spherical shape, what people had perceived to be a UFO [19]. Scientists have yet to discover why prominences are formed. The most promising answer they’ve developed being that the magnetic field that lies over the son contains prominence material. When it experiences a disruption, a prominence is formed [19].</p>

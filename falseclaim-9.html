            <h2>The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star.</h2>
            <p>A daily mail article depicted images of saturnâ€™s moons, iapetus and mimas, creating a very odd and bizarre claim that these were alien manufactured spaceships. Comparisons were drawn to the image of the death star from Star Wars, like a large crater or eye and a trench running across the equator.
            <br><br>
                This is a very strange claim, but is also a good example of how social media and pop culture can influence misinformation.This myth was first debunked when the Cassini flyship took pictures of Mimas and viewed from only 9500 km away [8].The line across the equator was seen to be a mountain ridge, and the large craters were simply craters [7]. This was a simple myth that was easily debunked, but managed to spread rapidly across twitter, reddit, and other social media platforms. This is because conspiracist mannerisms allowed for familiar information to be taken in, and the influences of pop culture made any implications on the myth.

            <h2>Flat Earth Conspiracy</h2>
            <p>There are many random arguments that are each refuted by simple physics and ancient proofs. Many statements that lack critical thinking, and many different pieces of historic and definite evidence that shows the earth is round. For example, people unable to see the curvature believe that it would be visible, when the Earth is just too much larger to see. All other claims are easily refuted. Even since ancient greek philosophers believed the Earth to be round, it has been common knowledge, proven again and again by islamic scholars, aristotle, and eratosthenes. You can also see photos and videos from space demonstrating its spherical shape. The reason Earth is spherical is due to the strong gravitational pull that holds its mass in a round shape.
                <br><br>
                The reason this claim has spread among so many genuine believers is a conspiracist mentality, social media, and low scientific knowledge [6]. People with certain mentalities are more susceptible to misleading information, and once exposed, media sites will selectively present similar information, creating a wider gap in scientific knowledge [6]. They lack the critical thinking skills to refute big bold false claims, and fall victim to keeping with the same mentality because of social media influences [6]..

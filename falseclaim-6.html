            <h2>Mars is the same size as the Moon.</h2>
            <p>This rumour began in 2003, and has resurfaced once a year ever since. 2003 was when Mars was in fact the closest itâ€™s been to Earth in 60,000 years [1]. The two planets were less than 35 million miles apart, a little bit over three light years. However, back then it was and still is scientifically impossible for the Moon and Mars to appear to be the same size. Although the Moon is smaller than Mars, about half the size [2], the diameter of Mars appears to be 1/140th of the diameter of the Moon [1]. Not to mention that Mars is an incredibly farther distance away than the moon. The moon is a light second away from Earth (186, 000 miles per second). Mars on the other hand, has light that travels to us from a few light minutes to 20 light minutes, depending on the position Earth and Mars are at in their orbit around the sun [1]. The hoax also assumes that we will be able to see two full spherical objects in the sky. However, assuming every two years that there will be a full moon on August 27th, is absurd and unreasonable.</p>

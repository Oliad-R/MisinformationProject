            <h2>There is a face on Mars.</h2>
            <p>The discovery of the ‘face’ began when the Viking 1 mission went on a search for Viking 2. On its journey it captured images of Mars for the usage of engineers at NASA. One of these images included a number of scattered rocks, one of which resembled a face [18]. Although the shadows and lighting make the ‘face’ appear to be incredibly real, scientists at NASA made a point to quickly refute these claims. The ‘face’ is in fact purely a large rock formation that looks as though it has eyes from precise shadows (NASA Science, 2001). To prove the point even further, Mars was visited once again by the Mars Global Surveyor, eighteen years after the Viking’s mission. Images were taken ten times sharper than the photos from 18 years ago. These images proved that the ‘face’ wasn’t a face, but a martian mesa. The region in which it’s located is filled with alike mesas, all with similar dimensions, none that are even remotely outlandish in any way  (NASA Science, 2001).</p>

            <h2>The Moon Landing was faked.</h2>
            <p>The first theorized motive was for the US to win the space race against the USSR. Many claimed the moon landing would be impossible, and that the USSR did not have the technology to monitor the US. This was debunked, as the USSR had already sent unmanned craft to land on the moon in 1959, and had not claimed the US cheated [16]. Article entries from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia report the landings as factual [10].
                <br><br>
                Another motive was to distract from the Vietnam War, claiming the landings abruptly ended at the same time as the US participation in the Vietnam War. This is quickly disproven by the fact that NASA stopped the landings due to budgeting issues, releasing a statement in 1970, 2 years before the end of the Vietnam War [16].
                <br><br>
                Common arguments given by conspirators use oddities in records of the landings. For example, the absence of stars in the photos, crosshairs seemingly being behind objects and other oddities [4]. The photos were shot in broad daylight, so stars were too dim to be seen. Overexposed images caused bright objects to bleed over crosshairs, making them appear faint. The expansive record of recordings, images, and even audio conversations are enough to debunk these claims [4].
                <br><br>
                One concern was shared by both NASA scientists and conspirators. The charged Van Allen belts were a fear for the astronauts, as there was a possibility of exposure to high levels of radiation. Conspirators believed this would be a reason why the moon landing was improbable, but was taken into consideration by the scientists. An aluminum shield was given, and measured higher radiation levels. NASAâ€™s solution managed to protect the astronauts [4].

                The final pieces of evidence are the LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) and the lunar laser planted by Armstrong and Aldrin. The LRO orbits the moon and takes high resolution photos that are able to detail the remnants of missions to the moon in extreme detail. The lunar laser and reflector array are still functioning today, allowing us to measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon [4].
                <br><br>
                Qualitative studies show that by isolating groups of conspirators and giving either critical or supportive information on conspiracy theories, conspirators were easily swayed in either direction. By survey, it was found that conspiracists adopted a skeptic behaviour and eccentric, isolating mannerisms [12].

            <h2>NASA is a waste of money.</h2>
            <p>Much of the public has a belief that NASA and space exploration are not worth their time, and too costly. This is a very common misconception because NASA tends to feel detached from the public, but in reality is an incredibly valuable agency that is providing innovation and information, but the false claims regarding expenses are also false [3]. According to Neil Degrasse Tyson, “It is not that we can’t afford it, but that we have chosen not to afford it” [5]. The entire NASA budget between 2005 and 2011 could have been funded with unused gift cards [5]. 
            <br><br>
                Although many believe that NASA is detached and not useful, it has contributed many great innovations and constant technologies for our understanding of Earth. It has been able to provide great data and information, and study the climate and forecasts [9]. NASA has even partnered with the NOAA to forecast severe weather [9]. NASA is developing clean energy, green technology, sustainable infrastructure, and studies and monitors global climate [9]. 
            <br><br>
                On top of greatly boosting STEM and creating many jobs [5], 2005 studies showed that space policy as a sector was one of the most influenced by public opinion [13], in contrast to other sectors like foreign and trade policy [13]. A common case of misconceptions and a lack of actual information furthers the feeling of distance and disbelief in NASA when it is heavily influenced by public voice, much lower budget, and contributes greatly to STEM.
